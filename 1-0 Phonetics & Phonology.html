# Phonetics & Phonology
## /fə'nɛtɪks/ /and/ /fə'nɒlədʒi/

---

## What is the difference between Phonetics and Phonology?

--

Phonetics  
- the study of the articulatory capabalities of the human vocal tract

--

> *i.e. the speech sounds that we produce for communication*

--

Phonology  
- the grammar of sounds  

--

> *i.e. how speech sounds form meaningful patterns*  

---

## Let's investigate.

.two-columns-left[
When the English tongue we speak  
Why is break not rhymed with weak?  
Won't you tell me why it's true  
We say sew, but also few?  
And the maker of a verse  
Cannot rhyme his horse with worse?
Beard is not the same as heard,  
Cord is different from word,  
Cow is cow, low is low,  
Shoe is never rhymed with foe.  
]

--

.two-columns-right[
Think of hose and dose and lose,  
And think of goose and yet of choose.  
Think of comb and tomb and bomb,  
Doll and roll and home and some.  
And since pay is rhymed with say,  
Why not paid with said I pray?  
Think of blood and food and good;  
Mould is not pronounced like could.  
Why is done, but gone and lone -  
Is there any reason known?  
]
--
.center[
To sum it up, it seems to me  
That sounds and letters don't agree.

## The trouble with spelling

--

English spelling is ***highly*** unreliable.  

---

# Enter phonetics.  

--

Phonetics can be helpful for learning.  

--

Also a useful, accurate means to describe the myriad speech sounds that speakers make.  

---

# Introducing the IPA  

--

- The International Phonetic Association

--

- created the IPA (International Phonetic Alphabet)

???
- alphabetic system of phonetic notation
- standardised representation of speech sounds

If the phoneme is technically not actually **observable**, how then do we infer its existence?  

How do we conduct experiments to test the validity of the hypothesis (of its existence)?

If we observe a pair of meaningful utterances that differ by **only** one sound, that difference must be meaningful.
]

.content-right-column[
The two different sounds can be identified to be discrete phonemes.

Now we have a hypothesis that these two phonemes exist, let's test the hypothesis by making more observations.

Sometimes we come across two phonemes that are phonetically similar.  

e.g. [k] in [skɜːt] and [kʰ] in [kʰɜːt]
]

--

.content-right-column[
But they do not form minimal pairs.  

e.g. [skɜːt] and [skʰɜːt] are not meaningfully different.
]

--

.content-right-column[
[k] and [kʰ] are *allophones* of the same phoneme /k/.
