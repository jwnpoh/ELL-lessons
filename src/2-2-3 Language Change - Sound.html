# Language Change
## Sound

## Recall:
## Phonetics vs Phonology

Not all differences in pronunciation is considered as sound change.

## Let's investigate.

- Find a space in or somewhere outside the classroom where you can be by yourself and record yourself saying these words:
  - library  
  - february  
  - access  
  - mischievous  
  - interesting  
  
- Please make a separate recording for each word. So you should end up with 5 audio files.  
- Upload them to our Google Classroom (assignment should have been posted already).

**Now compare your pronunciation of the words with your friend's.**  
What are some differences in your pronunciations?

.title-left-column[
## What is sound change?
## Variation or Change?
]

--

.content-right-column[
Many variants can exist at any one time.
]

--

.content-right-column[
But when there is convergence on one variant that is different from an earlier variant, we can say that sound change has taken place.
]

--
.content-right-column[
Consider the word "interesting".  
[ɪntəɹɛstiŋ] vs [ɪntɹɛstiŋ]
]

--
.content-right-column[
Sound change where /ə/ > ø ?
]

???
Just variation.

--

.content-right-column[
**Sound change is regular!**
]

---

## So how do we recognise change?

--

Let us consider /f/ .   
  
--

- In OE, /f/ had one allophone [f].  
> *wulfas pronounced [wulfɑs]*

--

- In ME, /f/ had two allophones [f] and [v].  
> *wulfas pronounced as [wulvɑs]*

--

- Over time, people converged on the [v] variant.

--

- In PDE, [f] and [v] are two different phonemes /f/ and /v/.

--

- We say that there is sound change here:
> *Voiceless fricatives occurring between voiced sounds become voiced.*

--

**Can you posit other words that have undergone the same change in sound?**
*Remember, sound change is regular.*

---

## Here's another example: [ʊː]

--

- From OE to PDE, the long high back rounded vowel changed to a diphthong.  
> [ʊː] > [ɑʊ]

--

Think of a few words from your core lexis in PDE that has the diphthong [ɑʊ].

???
- mouse
- house
- out
- louse

--

What do you think their OE pronunciation might have been?

--

Why do you think I specifically asked you to look into your core lexis?

???
Words that are likely to have been in OE would be in core lexis. Others (e.g. blouse) may seem similar but have different origins, and do not fit the paradigm for the particular sound change.

---

## One last example: [ə]

--

- From OE to PDE, word-final schwas were dropped.
> [ə] > ø

--

Again, let's try and find a few words and posit their likely pronunciations "back in the day".

## There is one more type of change:
### Spelling

???
Read the readings and post clarfication questions!
