## What criteria do we use to decide what constitutes a dialect, or a separate language?

### What criteria do we use to decide what constitutes a dialect, or a separate language?  

--

- Mutual intelligibility

--

  - Two speakers can understand each other in spite of some differences in
      - pronunciation (accent)
      - vocabulary
      - grammar

--

- Same written standard

--

  - Two varieties share the same written standard
      - Two speakers will be able to understand the same written text

--

  - National/Ethnic identity
      - If they belong in the same country they are the same language (the converse is also claimed)

## What's the main takeaway here?  
[2 min discussion]

---

### Key points:

--

If two speakers exhibit sufficiently distinct features in the language they speak, we describe them as ***varieties***.

--

Varieties can be considered dialects of the same language.

--

Or they can be considered different languages.

--

**The most objective term we can use is *varieties***.

--

*Languages* and *dialects* are social constructs. They exist to help people (speakers) make sense of how they are similar to or different from each other.

A language is a dialect with an army and a navy. - Max Weinreich
